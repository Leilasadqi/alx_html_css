# CSS Advanced Project

## Overview

This project follows the HTML, advanced project. The main focus is on enhancing the CSS and style of the web page. The design specifications are available on Figma, which you can access and duplicate to your drafts.

## Objectives

1. **Create and link CSS:**
   - Create a `styles.css` file.
   - Import `styles.css` in the `head` of your `index.html`.

2. **Implement design details:**
   - Use the Figma design file as a reference to style the page.
   - Ensure all elements are styled according to the design specifications.
   - Make any necessary changes to the HTML code (e.g., adding images for logos).

3. **Fonts:**
   - If your computer doesnâ€™t have the fonts used in the design, you can download them here: [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) and [Spin Cycle OT](link-to-spin-cycle-ot).

4. **Round values:**
   - Some values in the design are in float. Feel free to round them as needed.
